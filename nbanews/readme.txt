This project is myfirst scrapy spider.
In this project.I try to get url https://voice.hupu.com/nba/i (i=1,2,3,...) nba news's content.
I have encountered some problems.For examples,I don't konw how to extract url links content in the scrapy frame,I use requests + BeautifulSoup to solve this problems.
I don't konw hwo to extract recent news and how to avoid bringing conflicts with existing content.I can't solve these two problems until now.
I hope somebody can help me solve these two problems.Thanks.
I will continue do this work.
